This is my thesis for College. The goal was to create an application in which I would take an audio recording and generate a tone analysis from it using IBM Watson.

The project was built using AngularJS, Node.js, D3.js, Mongodb, AWS, and SOX (for audio file conversion).

Clone the repo then run
```
$ npm install
$ npm install --g gulp
$ mongod
$ gulp
```

The server will then be running on port 4000. 

Please note that this project was developed with Affiliated Creditors's systems in mind. As such, a few modifications will be required to use this project for other means.
