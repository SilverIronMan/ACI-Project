This is my thesis for College. The goal was to create an application in which I would take an audio recording and generate a tone analysis from it using IBM Watson.

The project was built using AngularJS, Node.js, D3.js, Mongodb, and SOX (for audio file conversion).

Clone the repo then run
```
$ npm install
$ npm install --g gulp
$ mongod
$ gulp
```

The server will then be running on port 4000.
